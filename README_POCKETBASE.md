# PocketBase Integration - Complete Setup Summary

## 🎉 Integration Complete!

Your Vault application has been fully integrated with PocketBase as the backend database. All authentication, file storage, and data management now use PocketBase instead of localStorage.

## 📋 What Has Been Set Up

### 1. **Authentication System**
- ✅ PocketBase SDK installed and configured
- ✅ `AuthContext` created for user authentication
- ✅ Login form updated with PocketBase authentication
- ✅ Signup form updated with password confirmation
- ✅ Automatic session management

### 2. **Data Layer**
- ✅ `PocketBaseProvider` replaces `FileSystemProvider`
- ✅ Real-time data syncing with PocketBase
- ✅ File upload/download functionality
- ✅ Support for all collections: files, folders, trash, colleagues, shares, workspace_invites

### 3. **Files Created**

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Option 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended)

**Step 1:** Download PocketBase
```bash
npm run setup:pocketbase
```

**Step 2:** Start PocketBase (Terminal 1)
```bash
npm run pocketbase
```

**Step 3:** Set up collections
1. Open http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/
2. Create admin account
3. Follow the collection setup in `POCKETBASE_SETUP.md`

**Step 4:** Start your app (Terminal 2)
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

See `POCKETBASE_SETUP.md` for detailed manual setup instructions.

## 📦 PocketBase Collections Schema

Your app uses the following collections:

1. **users** - User accounts (built-in)
2. **files** - File metadata and uploads
3. **folders** - Folder hierarchy
4. **trash** - Deleted items
5. **colleagues** - Friend/colleague relationships
6. **shares** - File/folder sharing
7. **workspace_invites** - Workspace collaboration

See `pocketbase-schema.md` for complete schema details.

## 🔑 Key Features

### Authentication
- Email/password authentication
- Automatic session persistence
- Secure logout functionality
- Password validation (min 8 characters)

### Data Management
- Real-time data synchronization
- User-specific data isolation
- File upload with metadata
- Folder hierarchy support
- Trash/archive functionality
- Sharing and collaboration features

### Security
- Row-level security with PocketBase API rules
- User data isolation (users can only see their own data)
- Secure file storage
- Protected API endpoints

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Running the App

You need **TWO terminals** running simultaneously:

**Terminal 1 - PocketBase Server:**
```bash
npm run pocketbase
# or
./pocketbase serve
```

**Terminal 2 - React Development Server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Testing

1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Click "Sign up" to create a test account
3. Verify email and password (min 8 chars)
4. Log in and test features:
   - File uploads
   - Folder creation
   - Favorites
   - Trash
   - Sharing features

## 📝 NPM Scripts

```json
{
  "dev": "vite",                    // Start React dev server
  "build": "tsc -b && vite build",  // Build for production
  "pocketbase": "./pocketbase serve", // Start PocketBase
  "setup:pocketbase": "bash download-pocketbase.sh" // Download PocketBase
}
```

## 🔄 Migration from localStorage

The old `FileSystemProvider` using localStorage is still in the codebase but is no longer used. To migrate existing data:

1. Export data from browser localStorage (developer tools)
2. Transform to match PocketBase schema
3. Import via PocketBase Admin UI or API

You can safely remove `src/services/filesys-store.tsx` after confirming everything works.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch" errors
- ✅ Ensure PocketBase is running on port 8090
- ✅ Check `src/lib/pocketbase.ts` has correct URL
- ✅ Verify CORS settings in PocketBase

### Authentication errors
- ✅ Verify collections exist with proper API rules
- ✅ Check password is at least 8 characters
- ✅ Ensure users collection allows creation

### File upload errors
- ✅ Verify `files` collection has `file` field (type: File)
- ✅ Check file size limits
- ✅ Ensure user is authenticated

### Data not loading
- ✅ Check browser console for errors
- ✅ Verify you're logged in
- ✅ Check PocketBase logs: `./pocketbase serve`

## 📁 Data Storage

PocketBase stores all data in the `pb_data` directory:

```
pb_data/
├── data.db           # SQLite database
├── storage/          # Uploaded files
└── logs.db          # System logs
```

**Important:** 
- `pb_data` is gitignored
- Backup this directory regularly
- Do not commit database files to git

## 🚢 Production Deployment

### Frontend (React App)
Deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or any static host:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Backend (PocketBase)
1. Deploy PocketBase to a server (DigitalOcean, AWS, Fly.io, etc.)
2. Set up HTTPS
3. Update `src/lib/pocketbase.ts` with production URL:
```typescript
export const pb = new PocketBase('https://your-domain.com');
```

### Environment Variables
Create `.env` files for different environments:
```
VITE_POCKETBASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8090  # Development
VITE_POCKETBASE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com  # Production
```

Update `src/lib/pocketbase.ts`:
```typescript
export const pb = new PocketBase(
  import.meta.env.VITE_POCKETBASE_URL || 'http://127.0.0.1:8090'
);
```

## ✅ Next Steps

Now that PocketBase is integrated, you should:

1. **Start PocketBase** and create collections (if not done already)
2. **Test authentication** by creating an account
3. **Test file uploads** and folder creation
4. **Review the schema** in `pocketbase-schema.md`
5. **Set up production deployment** when ready
